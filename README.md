# Google Cloud Speech Transcription Demo

## Tech used
- [Google Cloud Speech-to-Text](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/)
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)

## How to get started
Visit the [demo page](https://viktorfa.github.io/gcloud-transcription-web-client-vue/) to get a taste.
In order to transcribe your own files or recordings, you need to get a Gcloud API key. Do this by [creating a Google Cloud project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects), and enabling the Speech-to-Text API for that project. Then [create an API key](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) which you can use on the demo site.
